# Hey everyone, I'm Xinge Xu!

You can call me **Zinger**. I'm a first-year student at Western University (UWO), studying Computer Science.

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where I share the projects I'm building :D

Feel free to explore my work or reach out at [xingexu1107@gmail.com](mailto:xingexu1107@gmail.com or xxu767@uwo.ca). I'd be happy to connect!

## Poking around the code

It's a Next.js (App Router) site. Here's where everything lives:

- `src/app/` — routes and pages (home, `/projects`, `/resume`), plus the layout, metadata, sitemap, and the generated Open Graph image.
- `src/components/` — the actual UI: the animated day/night `Background`, the `Hero` section, `Resume`, `Projects`, and the small bits like `Nav` and `Footer`.
- `src/lib/` — small shared helpers (right now, just the audio context used for sound effects).
- `public/images/` — photos and animation frames used around the site.
- `public/resume/` — the resume PDF and the old flipbook frames it used to be built from.
- `public/icons/` — the default Next.js starter icons (mostly unused, kept around just in case).
- `scripts/` — one-off Python scripts, like the one that generates the circular avatar from a source photo.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and you're good to go.

## GitHub activity

`/api/github?year=2026` reads the calendar directly from `github.com/users/xingexu/contributions` and caches it for five minutes. It includes the public and anonymized private contributions shared on the GitHub profile, without exposing private repository names or requiring credentials. Keep **Contribution settings → Private contributions** enabled on your GitHub profile for private activity to appear. The number is GitHub's contribution total (commits, pull requests, reviews, and other qualifying activity), not a count of every commit on every branch.

The parser verifies all dates and checks that daily counts add up to GitHub's headline total. If GitHub changes its calendar markup or is unavailable, the tracker shows a retry option and a link to the profile instead of an incorrect total.

Page links fade out before navigating and fade in after the new route renders. Project sections reveal as they enter the viewport. These effects respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
